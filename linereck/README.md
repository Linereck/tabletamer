      "text": "Results and discussion\nThe steam distillation for 3 hours of aerial parts of C.\njaponica afforded essential oil (yellow) with a yield of\n0.06% (v/w) and the density of the concentrated essen-\ntial oil was determined to be 0.82 g/mL. The GC–MS\nanalysis of the essential oils of the aerial parts of C.\njaponica led to the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of a\ntotal of 37 major components accounting for 99.0% of\nthe\ntotal\ncomponents\npresent\n(Table\n1).\nLinalool\n(19.4%), trans-α-ionene (11.4%), α-terpineol (7.9%),\ndihydroactinolide (7.8%) and geranial (5.8%) were the\nmain components of the essential oil. In a previous\nreport (14), 30 components (e.g. sabinene, 4-terpineol,\nα-terpineol, piperitone, bornyl acetate) were identiﬁed\nbut the percentage content of the components was not\nprovided. However, the two main components (linalool\nand trans-α-ionene) in the present study were not\ndetected in the previous report (14). The above ﬁndings\nsuggest that further studies on plant cultivation and\nessential oil standardization are needed because of great\nvariations in chemical composition of essential oil of\nC. japonica aerial parts.\nThe essential oil of C. japonica aerial parts exhib-\nited contact toxicity against S. zeamais and T. castane-\num adults with LD50 values of 32.06 and 44.49 μg/\nadult, respectively (Table 2). Linalool, one of main\nconstituents of the essential oil, also possessed contact\ntoxicity against S. zeamais and T. castaneum adults with\nLD50 values of 13.90 and 8.12 μg/adult, respectively\n(20). However, the essential oil showed weak acute\ntoxicity against the two species of insects when com-\npared with the positive control (pyrethrum extract, 25%\npyrethrine I and pyrethrine II) because the pyrethrum\nextract possessed acute toxicity to maize weevils and\nred ﬂour beetles with LD50 values of 4.29 and 0.36 μg/\nadult, respectively (18).\nThe essential oil of C. japonica aerial parts also\npossessed strong fumigant activity against S. zeamais\nand T. castaneum adults with LC50 values of 7.54 and\n15.67 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). Linalool also\nshowed fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais and T. cas-\ntaneum adults with LC50 values of 10.46 and 9.34 mg/\nL air, respectively (20). The currently used grain fumi-\ngant, methyl bromide (MeBr) was reported to have\nfumigant activity against S. zeamais and T. castaneum\nadults with LC50 values of 0.67 and 1.75 mg/L air,\nrespectively (2). The essential oil was 11 and nine\ntimes less toxic to the maize weevils and red ﬂour bee-\ntles compared with the commercial fumigant MeBr.\nWhen compared with the other essential oils in the lit-\nerature, the essential oils C. japonica aerial parts exhib-\nited stronger or the same level of fumigant toxicity\nagainst\nthe\nmaize\nweevils,\ne.g.\nessential\noils\nof Murraya exotica (LC50=8.29 mg/L) (21), Artemisia\nlavandulaefolia\n(LC50=11.2 mg/L)\n(18),\nArtemisia\nvestita\n(LC50=13.42 mg/L)\n(22),\nIllicium\nsimonsii\n(LC50=14.95 mg/L) (23) and sieversiana sieversiana\n(LC50=15.0 mg/L) (18). Considering the currently used\nfumigants are synthetic insecticides, fumigant activity\nof the essential oil of C. japonica is quite promising.\nThese ﬁndings, considered together, suggest that the\nessential oil of C. japonica shows potential to be devel-\noped as a natural fumigant for control of stored-product\ninsects. However, further studies on the safety of the\nessential oil to humans and on development of formula-\ntions are necessary to improve the efﬁcacy and stability\nand to reduce cost.

A total of 37 components of the essential oil were identiﬁed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC–mass\nspectrometry (GC–MS). Linalool (19.4%), trans-α-ionene (11.4%), α-terpineol (7.9%), dihydroactinolide (7.8%) and\ngeranial (5.8%) were the main components of the essential oil. The essential oil exhibited strong fumigant toxicity\nagainst S. zeamais and T. castaneum adults with LC50 values of 10.05 and 15.67 mg/L air, respectively. Cayratia\njaponica essential oil also possessed contact toxicity against S. zeamais and T. castaneum adults with LD50 values of\n32.06 and 44.49 mg/adult, respectively. The essential oil C. japonica may have potential to be developed as a new\nnatural fumigant/insecticide for the control of stored-product insects.\nKeywords: Cayratia japonica; Sitophilus zeamais; Tribolium castaneum; contact toxicity; essential oil composition\nIntroduction\nBotanical pesticides have the advantage of providing\nnovel modes of action against insects that can reduce\nthe risk of cross-resistance as well as offering new\nleads for design of target-speciﬁc molecules (1). During\nthe screening program for new agrochemicals from\nChinese medicinal herbs, the essential oil of Cayratia\njaponica (Thunb.) Gagnepain (Family: Vitaceae) aerial\nparts was found to possess strong insecticidal toxicity\nagainst the maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais (Motsc-\nhulsky) and red ﬂour beetles, Tribolium castaneum\nHerbst. Sitophilus zeamais and T. castaneum are the\nmost widespread and destructive primary insect pests\nof stored cereals (2). Infestations not only cause signiﬁ-\ncant losses due to the consumption of grains, they also\nresult in elevated temperature and moisture conditions\nthat lead to an accelerated growth of molds, including\ntoxigenic species (3). The control of this insect relies\nheavily on the use of synthetic insecticides and fumi-\ngants, which has led to problems such as disturbances\nof the environment, increasing costs of application, pest\nresurgence, pest resistance to pesticides and lethal\neffects on non-target organisms in addition to direct\ntoxicity to users. An alternative to synthetic pesticides\nis the use of natural compounds such as essential oils\nthat result from secondary metabolism in plants. The\ntoxicity of a large number of essential oils and their\nconstituents has been evaluated against a number of\nstored-product insects (4).\nBushkiller or sorrel vine (C. japonica) is an her-\nbaceous vine that climbs by means of branched ten-\ndrils. Cayratia japonica and is native to a wide area\nof temperate and southeast Asia. It has been reported\nfrom Japan, southern China, Indo-China, the Philip-\npines, Taiwan, New Guinea and Queensland (5). It\naggressively spreads from an aggressive and invasive\nroot system. A single plant can quickly cover a large\narea, including the existent vegetation. Aerial parts\nand roots of C. japonica are used in traditional Chi-\nnese medicine to relieve swelling and heat, and to\nenhance diuresis and detoxiﬁcation (6, 7). Roots of\nC. japonica are also used in Malaysia and Thailand\ntraditionally to treat cancer (8).

      "text": "Results and discussion\nThe steam distillation for 3 hours of aerial parts of C.\njaponica afforded essential oil (yellow) with a yield of\n0.06% (v/w) and the density of the concentrated essen-\ntial oil was determined to be 0.82 g/mL. The GC–MS\nanalysis of the essential oils of the aerial parts of C.\njaponica led to the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of a\ntotal of 37 major components accounting for 99.0% of\nthe\ntotal\ncomponents\npresent\n(Table\n1).\nLinalool\n(19.4%), trans-α-ionene (11.4%), α-terpineol (7.9%),\ndihydroactinolide (7.8%) and geranial (5.8%) were the\nmain components of the essential oil. In a previous\nreport (14), 30 components (e.g. sabinene, 4-terpineol,\nα-terpineol, piperitone, bornyl acetate) were identiﬁed\nbut the percentage content of the components was not\nprovided. However, the two main components (linalool\nand trans-α-ionene) in the present study were not\ndetected in the previous report (14). The above ﬁndings\nsuggest that further studies on plant cultivation and\nessential oil standardization are needed because of great\nvariations in chemical composition of essential oil of\nC. japonica aerial parts.\nThe essential oil of C. japonica aerial parts exhib-\nited contact toxicity against S. zeamais and T. castane-\num adults with LD50 values of 32.06 and 44.49 μg/\nadult, respectively (Table 2). Linalool, one of main\nconstituents of the essential oil, also possessed contact\ntoxicity against S. zeamais and T. castaneum adults with\nLD50 values of 13.90 and 8.12 μg/adult, respectively\n(20). However, the essential oil showed weak acute\ntoxicity against the two species of insects when com-\npared with the positive control (pyrethrum extract, 25%\npyrethrine I and pyrethrine II) because the pyrethrum\nextract possessed acute toxicity to maize weevils and\nred ﬂour beetles with LD50 values of 4.29 and 0.36 μg/\nadult, respectively (18).\nThe essential oil of C. japonica aerial parts also\npossessed strong fumigant activity against S. zeamais\nand T. castaneum adults with LC50 values of 7.54 and\n15.67 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). Linalool also\nshowed fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais and T. cas-\ntaneum adults with LC50 values of 10.46 and 9.34 mg/\nL air, respectively (20). The currently used grain fumi-\ngant, methyl bromide (MeBr) was reported to have\nfumigant activity against S. zeamais and T. castaneum\nadults with LC50 values of 0.67 and 1.75 mg/L air,\nrespectively (2). The essential oil was 11 and nine\ntimes less toxic to the maize weevils and red ﬂour bee-\ntles compared with the commercial fumigant MeBr.\nWhen compared with the other essential oils in the lit-\nerature, the essential oils C. japonica aerial parts exhib-\nited stronger or the same level of fumigant toxicity\nagainst\nthe\nmaize\nweevils,\ne.g.\nessential\noils\nof Murraya exotica (LC50=8.29 mg/L) (21), Artemisia\nlavandulaefolia\n(LC50=11.2 mg/L)\n(18),\nArtemisia\nvestita\n(LC50=13.42 mg/L)\n(22),\nIllicium\nsimonsii\n(LC50=14.95 mg/L) (23) and sieversiana sieversiana\n(LC50=15.0 mg/L) (18). Considering the currently used\nfumigants are synthetic insecticides, fumigant activity\nof the essential oil of C. japonica is quite promising.\nThese ﬁndings, considered together, suggest that the\nessential oil of C. japonica shows potential to be devel-\noped as a natural fumigant for control of stored-product\ninsects. However, further studies on the safety of the\nessential oil to humans and on development of formula-\ntions are necessary to improve the efﬁcacy and stability\nand to reduce cost.
