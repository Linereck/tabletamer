,,,,,,,,"Notes: Components are listed in order of elution in apolar column (HP-5); RIa, RIb, retention indices calculated using respectively an apolar column (HP-5) and polar column (HP-Innowax); RI1, RI2, retention indices according to bibliographic data on an apolar column (1) and polar column (2); MS, mass spectrometry; CoI, co-injection; RI, retention indice; volatile compound proportions were calculated from the chromatograms obtained on the HP-Innowax column. Values followed by the same small letter did not share significant differences at p<0.05 (Duncan test)."
